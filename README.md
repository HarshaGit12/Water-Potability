# Water-Potability
## Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection.
## The dataset contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies.
# Project Overview:
## 1. Data Cleaning is done and NaN/missing values are imputed using mean
## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis is done and distributions of features is also shown
## 3. Three Classification Algorithms - Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost Classifier are used to model the data
## 4. Out of the 3 Classification models, Random Forest gives better Au-ROC score of 0.79, hence this model is chosen
